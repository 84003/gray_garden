Welcome to my digital garden, where I seed, grow, and intertwine content. The first subject I'm exploring is <a href="/information-theory.html" class="internal-link">Information Theory</a>. 

You can find more information about this digital garden by reading <a href="/about-the-process.html" class="internal-link">about the process</a>, <a href="/about-how-it-was-built.html" class="internal-link">how it was built</a>, how each entry is <a href="/about-the-formatting.html" class="internal-link">formatted</a>, and the idea behind <a href="/about-the-structure.html" class="internal-link">the structure</a>.

The network visualization below can be used for navigating this digital garden. It gives you an overview of every entry and the links between them.

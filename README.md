# Gray Garden

A digital garden with sample content, integrated with Obsidian so that all entries can be organized and published from an Obsidian vault directly to the web. Made with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, based on the [template](https://digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app/) by Maxime Vaillancourt and the [green template](https://garden.megu.space/your-first-note.html#installation) by megu.

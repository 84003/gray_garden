The written language of 3000 BC Ancient Egypt is called hieroglyphics. It was a [form of communication reserved for governmental, fiscal, and religious purposes, and practiced by scribes](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory/info-theory/v/history-of-the-alphabet-language-of-coins-3-9).

[Hieroglyphics comprise symbols of two categories: signs denoting sounds and signs denoting one concept](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/writing/system1.html).

Understanding that hieroglyphics is a phonetic, not a pictorial language was made possible by [[The Rosetta Stone]].

Stone was the commonly used medium for hieroglyphics, withstanding time due to its durability. A new medium was emerging around the same time, [[Papyrus]] â€” one of the many crops grown along the Nile, which was sliced, soaked, and pressed, glued together by the sugars to form a paper document. 

In contrast to stone tablets, papyrus was less durable but more mobile, so it was ideal for traveling across space rather than time.

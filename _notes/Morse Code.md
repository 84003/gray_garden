User interface was developed: a spring-loaded lever, the interaction invoolved tapping a finger on the lever to produce 

on the receiving end the finger tap would be reproduced.

the lever would be pulled by a strong electromagnet to produce the exact same movement.

To create one difference, Morse used two different lengths of a finer tap (i.e., the pulse width).

A short tap is represented as a *dot*, and a longer tap (equal to three units of *dots*) is represented as *dash*.

Dot = O
Dash = —

For example, to send the letter R, would be O — O.

Similar to the method behind the Gauss-Webber Telegraph, letters that are most common are assigned the shortest sets of dots and dashes. The letter E for example is assigned a single tap.

Between each letter there is a three unit pause, which means it relies on a rhythm to send letters accurately.

Take a look at this chap talk about the importance of timing and rhythm:

so the [[Signaling Rate]] is related to the tempo of the signal

As more and more people began using this system, code books were developed and distributed, containing single words that were mapped onto to common sentences.

Telegraph companies

This meant a sentence could be sent at the cost of sending a word.

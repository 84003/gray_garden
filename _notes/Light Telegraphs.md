Using just a single difference to communicate the alphabet became prevalent in the 17th century.

[In combination with the telescope (invented 1608), the X device enabled utilizing this method across much greater distances. This meant a message could be sent from London to Paris, which instigated a surge in new inventions for passing differences.](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory/info-theory/v/history-of-optical-telegraphs-language-of-coins-5-9)

The shutter telegraph developed by Lord George Murray.
A technology from 1795 demonstrates the use of a single difference to communicate anything. 

Composed of six rotating shutters, in a two by three grid.

Each shutter could be either open or closed, so fo each shutter there is a single shutter.

That is 2 to the power of 6, which means 64 differences in total.

Example:

a decision tree visualization of this creates a path like this:

at the end of this decision tree are all the letter of the alphabet and a set of number.

So to get to B, the sequence would be 

closed closed closed closed open

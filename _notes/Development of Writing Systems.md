A common pattern in the development of writing systems is that as the medium changes from stone tablets to paper, thereby changing the method of inscription, and as writing is practiced by more people rather than a select a few, symbols evolve from representing objects or ideas to representing sounds.

## Ancient Writing Systems

Around 30,000 BC natural materials were used to make pictorial representations of reality. Starting with [[Pictograms|pictograms]] (symbols that resemble the object represented) and later [[Ideograms|ideograms]] (conceptual symbols representing abstract ideas). Newer levels of abstraction emerged around 31,100 BC, with the application of [[The Rebus Principle]] (combining existing symbols to represent sounds). 

From around 3000 BC to 650 BC, there is a shift from using stone tablets to paper, and [[Writing Systems From Symbols to Letters|writing systems evolve from using symbols to using letters]].

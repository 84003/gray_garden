This digital garden is built using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), transforming text written in Markdown to a static website. This template incorporates [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in the workflow:

1. Develop and organize content in Obsidian.
2. Host on Github.
3. Deploy on Netlify.

[Megumi Tanaka's template](https://megumi.co), which is based on [Maxime Vaillancourt's template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template,), was modified by me in 2022. To install the Jekyll template, I followed [these steps](https://garden.megu.space/your-first-note.html#installation), with a few modifications:

1. Create new repository from the [Github Template](https://github.com/meewgumi/digital-garden-apache-template) 
2. Customize `_config.yml` 
3. ~~Sign up for [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/r/nx7qct)~~ 
4. Connect Github repository to ~~DeployHQ~~ Netlify 
5. Add server's FTP or SSH information 
6. Configure [Jekyll Build Commands](https://www.deployhq.com/guides/jekyll) on ~~DeployHQ~~ Netlify ~~and turn `vendor` caching on~~ 
7. Deploy and setup up automatic deployment. 

Then, to develop and organize all entries in Obsidian, I followed [these steps](https://garden.megu.space/obsidian-setup.html), with the addition of a staging area in the `_notes` directory.

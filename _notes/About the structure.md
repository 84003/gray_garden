Navigating from entry to entry means a change in the level of detail. Entries with a broad subject title, such as [[Information Theory]], are top-level categories containing introductory content with links to other entries. Top-level category entries link to subcategory entries. Navigating from top level to subcategory means an increase in the level of detail on the subject. One path, for example, is: [[Information Theory]] ‚û°Ô∏è [[Devices For Sending Information]] ‚û°Ô∏è [[Telegraphs]] ‚û°Ô∏è [[Electromagnetic Telegraphs]] ‚û°Ô∏è [[Quadruplex Telegraph]] ‚û°Ô∏è [[Channel Capacity]].

The structure is also conveyed in how each entry is categorized. This entry, for example, has the category `Configuration` (top level), `Information Structure` (sub level), and `Summary` (the form).

*Note: Both the `status` and the `category` in the metadata function as tags enabling a grouping mechanism and the possibility to filter entries. As it is now, tags only work in Obsidian but will be developed to function on this website as clickable tags.*

Moving from entry to entry means a change in the level of detail.
Entries with a broad subject title, such as [[Information Theory]] for example, are top level categories containing introductory content with link to other entries. Top level category entries link to subcategory entries. Navigating from top to lower level category entries means that the level of detail on the subject increases. One path, for example, is: [[Information Theory]] ‚û°Ô∏è [[Devices For Sending Information]] ‚û°Ô∏è [[Telegraphs]] ‚û°Ô∏è [[Electromagnetic Telegraphs]] ‚û°Ô∏è [[Quadruplex Telegraph]] ‚û°Ô∏è [[Channel Capacity]].

The structure is also conveyed in how each entry is categorized. This entry for example, has the category `Configuration` (top level), `Information Structure` (sub level), and `Summary` (the form).

*Note: Both the `status` and the `category` in the metadata function as tags enabling a grouping mechanism and the possibility to filter entries. As it is now, tags only work in Obsidian, but will be developed to function on this website as clickable tags.*

The rebus principle was applied to represent abstract words that were otherwise difficult to represent with pictograms. The rebus principle entails [using existing symbols, such as pictograms, for the phonetic sound to represent new words. An early example is the Narmer Palette containing a hieroglyphic inscription, found along the Nile River in Egypt, dated around 31100 BC](https://youtu.be/lkeXaqoXDYQ?t=347).

As seen in the image below, at the very top, between the two-horned heads, there is an inscription of the name Narmer. The symbol for catfish is used for the syllable "nar" and the symbol of a chisel is used for the syllable "mer."

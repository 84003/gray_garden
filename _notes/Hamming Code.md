Richard Hamming

1940s 

Bell Laboratory

[In the 1940s computers stored information in the form of punch cards, where a hole represents 1 and no hole represented 0. ](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory/moderninfotheory/v/testtest)

This system was error prone. 

because cards could get bent or puched incorrectly.

such errors would cause the system to halt until the fault in the system could be found and corrected manually.

This was the problem Hamming sought to solve by devising a method that would detect and correct single bit errors automatically without interrupting calculations

Hamming based his method on the concept of a *parity bit*, which is a single bit that is added to the end of a sequence indicating whether the number of 1s in a sequence is even or odd, enabliing the receiver to detect whether an error has occurred.

Correcting the error entails knowing which part of the sequence is incorrect.

Hamming added more parity bits to convey information about the location of the error.
